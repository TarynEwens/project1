# Project 1 - WOOFER (It's like Twitter... for dogs!)
A simple tic tac toe (naughts and crosses) game with a minimalist vibe.

See it in action here: https://wooferproject.herokuapp.com/

It is a social media platform (basically a Twitter clone) but for users to sign up on behalf of their dogs and "woof" (instead of "tweet") at their dog friends!



## How to use
- Sign up on the home page, update your doggos details, then you're ready to 'woof'!
- Post your woofs from the home page
- Find other doggos to follow on the users page
- View a doggos profile and click 'follow' to add their woofs to your home feed!
- Unfollow if you need, delete embarrassing past tweets, and edit or delete your account at any time (Much disappoint. Many sad.)

## Objectives
- App should have at least 3 models. Currently Users, Woofs & Relationships.
- Views. Use partials to DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
- Handles invalid data. Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs.
- Validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses and secure passwords.
- Use Gems Use a GEM that talks to an API to add functionality to your app. Currently "Cloudinary".
- User Login. Make sure you have basic authentication and authorization set up (if you need it).
- Heroku. Deploy your code to Heroku.
