# Project 1 - WOOFER (It's like Twitter... for dogs!)

See it in action here: https://wooferproject.herokuapp.com/

It is a social media platform (basically a Twitter clone) but for users to sign up on behalf of their dogs and "woof" (instead of "tweet") at their dog friends!

## How to use
- Sign up on the home page, update your doggos details, then you're ready to 'woof'!
- Post your woofs from the home page

- Find other doggos to follow on the users page
- View a doggos profile and click 'follow' to add their woofs to your home feed!

- Unfollow if you need, delete embarrassing past tweets, and edit or delete your account at any time (Much disappoint. Many sad.)
